Parcellating whole brain for individuals by simple linear iterative clustering
Copyright (C) 2016 Jing Wang

Generating whole brain atlas with resting-state fMRI data using normalized 
cuts (Ncut) and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC). The parcellaiton
is only performed in the individual subject level. In order to generate 
parcellations with multiple granularities, we vary the cluster number in a 
wide range. The two parcellation algorithms are compared under four 
evaluation metrics, i.e., the difference between the initialized cluster 
number and the average actual cluster number, spatial discontiguity index, 
functional homogeneity and reproducibility. 

Usage:
Run m1_main.m to play the demo. 

Notes:
1. You might download the NIFTI toolbox and Craddock's demo data manually.
2. For parallel computing, carefully choose the number of parallel workers
   to make the most of the hardware resources and to avoid problems such
   as the out of memory problem.
3. It requires quite a lot of memory even with only 3 parallel workers, so
   it is suggested to run on a server rather than a personal computer. You
   might set more parallel workers if accessible.
4. The number of redundant eigenvectors is set arbitrarily, and should be 
   set larger in case of error when applying the scripts on other databases.
